# Deep Research AI

This project builds a **Dual-Agent Research System** that can search the web, extract information, and answer queries intelligently. It uses **Tavily API**, **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **Transformers**.

## Features
- Search the web using Tavily API.
- Analyze and answer queries based on the search results.
- Modular design with utilities and agents separated.
- Supports future extensions like citation tracking, multi-hop reasoning, etc.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Tavily API
- LangChain
- LangGraph
- HuggingFace Transformers (DistilBERT QA model)
- TensorFlow

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-research-ai.git
cd deep-research-ai
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have `requirements.txt`, install manually:
```bash
pip install langchain tavily-python tensorflow transformers langgraph
```

### 3. Add API Key
Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your Tavily API Key:
```env
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key_here
```

### 4. Run the Project
```bash
python agents/working.py
```

It will ask a question (like "Latest AI in medicine research?"), search online, and output an answer based on the retrieved data.

## Notes
- If you see TensorFlow warnings, they are safe to ignore.
- If using **Anaconda**, make sure the correct environment is activated.
- Currently runs on CPU â€” GPU acceleration is optional.
